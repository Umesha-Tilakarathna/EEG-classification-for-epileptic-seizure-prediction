The paper EEG signal classification using PCA, ICA, LDA, and support vector
machines (1) was published by Subasi and Gursoy in 2010. This work presents
a method for analyzing and classifying Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect
epileptic seizures, which is a critical diagnostic support for neurologists. The study leverages
advanced techniques in signal processing and machine learning. Key steps include:
1. Signal Decomposition: EEG signals are decomposed into frequency sub-bands
using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is particularly suited for analyzing
non-stationary signals.
2. Feature Extraction and Reduction: Statistical features are extracted from these
sub-bands. Dimension reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis
(LDA) are applied to streamline the data.
3. Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVM): The extracted features
are classified using SVM into two categoriesâ€”epileptic and no-epileptic.
The study compares the performance of classifiers built using PCA, ICA, and LDA for
feature extraction and demonstrates that SVM with LDA outperforms the others in terms
of accuracy. This framework has the potential to enhance automated diagnostic systems
for epilepsy, offering a robust approach to EEG signal classification.
In this report, we present our re-implementation of the methodologies outlined in the
paper. This includes a detailed account of the procedures we followed, the specific challenges
encountered during the implementation, and the results obtained. Furthermore,
we provide a comprehensive comparison between the outcomes of our re-implementation
and those reported in the original study, offering insights into the reproducibility and
practical applicability of the proposed methods. This work not only validates the original
findings but also highlights areas for potential enhancement in future EEG classification
systems. <-- give this to me in latex text format
